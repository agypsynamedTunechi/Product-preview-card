## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time using SCSS, and honestly it was a bit confusing. Although it makes debugging much more easier than using CSS.

### Continued development

I plan to continue learn SCSS and what folder to place the different functionalities of the site.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4) - This YouTube video helped me learn the basics of SCSS and how it works.
